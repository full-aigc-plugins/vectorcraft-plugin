## 1. Cross-version architecture constraints

Dependencies flow from Skills through Harness and Runtime Adapter to Native CLI. Creative knowledge, execution state, native projects and cross-plugin projects have distinct owners. Upstream responses, model suggestions and user assets cannot directly advance acceptance state.

## 2. Layers and boundaries

| Component | Authoritative data | Must not own |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Skills | Procedural knowledge, triggers and domain methods | Task state or secrets |
| Domain Harness | Domain plans, project revisions and child task ledger | Other plugins’ internal state |
| Runtime Adapter | Command mappings and capability snapshots | Changing creative goals |
| Native CLI | Native objects, edits and rendering | Cross-plugin project authority |
| ArtCraft | Brief, DAG, asset versions and aggregate delivery | Fabricating child success |


## 3. Deployment and data

V1 uses a local single-user workspace: read-only plugin packages, versioned runtimes and user-managed project state and assets. JSON receipts isolate language and host differences. SaaS, message brokers and distributed transactions are not dependencies.

## 4. Detailed design ownership

[Complete runtime architecture](../../../docs/VectorCraft-Runtime-Architecture.md)

The detailed architecture owns processes, states, interfaces, recovery, upgrade, resource budgets and operations. V1 architecture records only release scope and deltas. Change OpenSpec before external behavior; narrative documentation cannot silently alter contracts.

**Document status**: Ready for review; implementation status is governed by OpenSpec tasks and evidence.


Actual public56/source42 isolated Codex0.153.4 installation qualifies all six current VC-DM-006 scenarios with13 unchanged skill digests. Two swatch routes,eight erroneous-update refusals,two raster and two SVG consumers,nine asset export decodes,three unchanged unrelated SVG/PDF/PNG outputs,unknown-token refusal and both linked-plan refusals pass. Failed checkpoints reopen independently without replay. Task4.18 closes:111 complete/16 open. GUI,model creative quality,other platforms,all formats,cross-file/external-editor behavior,Art bundled distribution and full V1 remain unverified.
