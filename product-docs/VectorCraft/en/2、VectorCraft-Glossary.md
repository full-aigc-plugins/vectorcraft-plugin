## 1. Shared vocabulary

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| CreativeBrief | Creative goals and constraints; no execution state |
| DomainPlan | Declarative editing plan for a domain tool |
| ProjectRevision | Revision identity of a native project and its dependencies |
| TaskReceipt | Execution identity, state and result references |
| ArtifactManifest | Logical asset identity, immutable version, provenance and dependencies |
| CapabilitySnapshot | Discovered interface capabilities for a runtime and execution mode |
| QualityVerdict | Artifact-bound technical, creative and acceptance results |
| reconciling | Reconcile uncertain side effects before retry |
| lossReport | Losses from interchange, baking or font substitution |
| VectorDesignPlan | Domain-plan object; fields are specified by V1 domain requirements |
| Document | Domain-plan object; fields are specified by V1 domain requirements |
| PathObject | Domain-plan object; fields are specified by V1 domain requirements |
| Artboard | Domain-plan object; fields are specified by V1 domain requirements |

## 2. State and evidence vocabulary

| Term | Meaning and limit |
| :--- | :--- |
| planned | Defined intent; not executed |
| accepted | Request acknowledged, not completed |
| verified | Specific checks passed, not automatic creative acceptance |
| completed | Current revision satisfies acceptance conditions |
| NOT_RUN | No check evidence; never equivalent to PASS |
| preview | Review representation, not proof of native editability |


## 3. Units and versions

Record protocol, plugin, skill and upstream CLI versions separately. Time uses explicit units and rational bases; color records space, depth and alpha interpretation. Version strings do not replace content hashes. “Supported” requires evidence for the relevant version, mode and case.
