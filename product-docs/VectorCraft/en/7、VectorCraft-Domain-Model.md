## 1. Aggregates and authority

| Component | Authoritative data | Must not own |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Skills | Procedural knowledge, triggers and domain methods | Task state or secrets |
| Domain Harness | Domain plans, project revisions and child task ledger | Other plugins’ internal state |
| Runtime Adapter | Command mappings and capability snapshots | Changing creative goals |
| Native CLI | Native objects, edits and rendering | Cross-plugin project authority |
| ArtCraft | Brief, DAG, asset versions and aggregate delivery | Fabricating child success |


## 2. Domain objects

| Object | Invariant |
| :--- | :--- |
| VectorDesignPlan | Stable identity and explicit revision; mutations validated by its owning aggregate |
| Document | Stable identity and explicit revision; mutations validated by its owning aggregate |
| PathObject | Stable identity and explicit revision; mutations validated by its owning aggregate |
| Artboard | Stable identity and explicit revision; mutations validated by its owning aggregate |
| BrandToken | Stable identity and explicit revision; mutations validated by its owning aggregate |


## 3. Relationship model

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class CreativeBrief
    class DomainPlan
    class TaskReceipt
    class ArtifactManifest
    class QualityVerdict
    CreativeBrief "1" --> "many" DomainPlan : constrains
    DomainPlan "1" --> "many" TaskReceipt : executes
    TaskReceipt "1" --> "many" ArtifactManifest : produces
    ArtifactManifest "1" --> "many" QualityVerdict : reviewed by
    ArtifactManifest --> ArtifactManifest : derived from
```

## 4. Domain events and consistency

Events include plan.created, execution.started, execution.outcome_unknown, artifact.verified, review.accepted and revision.invalidated. Events provide append-only audit; current ledger state changes transactionally and replay must be idempotent. Asset dependencies cannot cycle and accepted versions cannot mutate in place. ArtCraft’s public specifications own protocol fields.
