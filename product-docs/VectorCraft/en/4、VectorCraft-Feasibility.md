## 1. Confirmed facts and feasibility

On macOS arm64, local CLI 0.2.0 version checks, MCP initialize, tools/list and one read-only tools/call passed for all four applications. Sanitized evidence comes from this workspace’s installation receipts. It does not cover GUIs, real media edits, output fidelity, all commands or cross-plugin jobs.

## 2. Feasibility matrix

| Area | Assessment | Evidence gap |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Command automation entrypoints | High: runtime entrypoints observed | Per-command positive and negative fixtures |
| Editable delivery | Medium: formats exist; workflow unverified | Representative project reopen and object inspection |
| Selective cross-plugin rework | Medium: new protocols and scheduling required | DAG and real child-job integration |
| Cross-platform host release | Unverified | Evidence for each host, platform and mode |


## 3. Proof-of-concept and exit criteria

Create logo and icon assets in .vectorcraft, SVG and PNG; change a brand color and update bound variants while preserving unrelated colors.

Retain failing artifacts and runtime identity, then locate the issue in capabilities, mappings, assets or verification. Do not lower output standards to make a PoC pass; change OpenSpec first when scope changes.

## 4. Risks and owners

| Risk | Detection | Mitigation and owner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| R1 | Upstream command or format changes | Runtime owner: pin releases, diff schemas and rerun fixtures; keep old version until verified |
| R2 | Text, alpha or color loss on handoff | Domain owner: retain native sources, emit loss reports and inspect pixels and objects |
| R3 | Duplicate submission after disconnect | Harness owner: persist intent and idempotency keys, reconcile before retry |
| R4 | Design documentation mistaken for implementation | Release owner: planned feature status; no marketplace entry without working skills and runtime |
| R5 | ArtCraft branding and restricted-source boundaries | Maintainer: independent implementation; do not copy ArtCraft/Services source; clear branding before distribution |
