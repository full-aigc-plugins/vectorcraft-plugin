# VectorCraft Agent Plugin

Independent-skills-driven Editable vector brand assets and multi-artboard design.

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

## Current release and reproducible host checks

Previously verified plugin/skill suite: `0.1.0-dev.3`. Codex 0.147.0 and 0.153.4 installed five fixed public releases and discovered all 58 enabled namespaced skills with zero loading errors and matching source digests. Five representative workflows passed through installed task-skill entrypoints on 0.147.0, including native projects, targeted revisions and the mixed ArtCraft online workflow. Model dispatch, desktop GUI, final creative review and full interchange fidelity remain unverified.

[Host verification design](docs/VectorCraft-Host-Verification-Architecture.md) · [Version-bound evidence](docs/evidence/codex-skill-suite.json). Historical milestones below retain their original scope; the current manifest and locks own version identity.

> Development release. Fixed-tag Codex installation, skill discovery and representative native workflows have passed; complete product and creative acceptance remain open.

Implementation has started in the independent skills package. The isolated first-use installer is tested on macOS arm64; complete creative workflows and plugin host acceptance remain pending. [Evidence](docs/evidence/bootstrap-tests.json)

The independent skill now includes a native workflow helper: shapes and paths, Boolean union, editable text, two artboards, SVG/PNG/PDF exports and targeted recoloring were exercised. It preserves unbound objects and exports in the fixture. This does not prove full plugin acceptance. [Workflow evidence](docs/evidence/vector-workflow-tests.json)

## Positioning

Create logo and icon assets in .vectorcraft, SVG and PNG; change a brand color and update bound variants while preserving unrelated colors.

For creators who need editable native projects, repeatable revisions and reliable automation.

## Capabilities and boundaries

| Capability | Behavioral boundary | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Paths, shapes and coordinates | Define artboard coordinates, units, control points, path closure and strokes; preview pixels are not vector path authority. | Full scope pending |
| Grouping and boolean operations | Record operand IDs, boolean operation and result identity with a pre-operation checkpoint; failure must not destroy source objects. | Full scope pending |
| Brand colors and text | Bind brand colors using explicit tokens instead of global color replacement; retain text and font dependencies and report editability loss when outlining. | Full scope pending |
| Artboards and variants | Give each artboard a stable ID, name, size and output mapping; define preview ordering and export ranges without index-base ambiguity. | Full scope pending |
| Interchange fidelity scope | Validate native .vectorcraft, SVG, PDF and PNG separately; report rasterized effects and keep native sources when interchange cannot preserve them. | Full scope pending |
| Brand variant revision | Update related variants from token and asset dependencies and verify that unrelated object properties and outputs remain unchanged. | Full scope pending |

Does not rewrite upstream editors, silently change native deliverable formats, or claim GUI/cross-platform acceptance.

## Architecture and documentation

- [Complete runtime architecture](docs/VectorCraft-Runtime-Architecture.md)
- [Technical plan and roadmap](product-docs/VectorCraft/en/5%E3%80%81VectorCraft-Technical-Plan.md)
- [V1 PRD and requirement mapping](product-docs/VectorCraft/en/V1/5%E3%80%81VectorCraft-PRD-V1.md)
- [Complete documentation index](docs/README.md)
- [OpenSpec proposal](openspec/changes/establish-v1-plugin/proposal.md)
- [OpenSpec tasks](openspec/changes/establish-v1-plugin/tasks.md)

- [Domain technical design](docs/VectorCraft-Domain-Design.md)

## Currently executable quick start

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_docs.py
openspec validate establish-v1-plugin --strict --no-interactive
```
These commands validate documentation and specifications, not product workflows. OpenSpec validation uses 1.13.1; this repository does not install tools automatically.

After installing the official CLI, perform a basic check:

```bash
vectorcraft-cli --version
```

The recorded result is 0.2.0. The public independent-skill bootstrap and workflow are development entry points; plugin-host installation remains unverified.

## Configuration and runtime

Target configuration includes CLI paths, allowed read/write roots, execution mode, budget, timeout and output directory; the configuration schema is not implemented yet. The skills lock pins the published source commit and whole-skill digest. Runtime lock hashes identify real official artifacts and establish only the recorded platform’s smoke evidence.

## Reliability and security

Planned safeguards include project write locks, revision preconditions, persisted intent, idempotency keys, outcome reconciliation, native checkpoints, artifact hashes and bounded revisions. Secrets are host-managed references; asset metadata is never an execution instruction.

## Verification and maturity

[Sanitized CLI evidence](docs/evidence/runtime-baseline.json)

| Layer | Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| Upstream CLI and read-only MCP | Observed on macOS arm64 only |
| Independent skill and adapter | Technical workflow tested; full harness pending |
| Native project and creative acceptance | Native technical cases pass; creative acceptance pending |
| Target host installation | Codex controlled install/discovery pass; full host acceptance pending |


## Roadmap and contribution

| Phase | Deliverable | Exit evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| D0 | Bilingual documentation and OpenSpec baseline | Document, link and spec validation; implementation tasks remain open |
| M1 | Independent skills and runtime adapter | Clean installation, checksums and real MCP invocation |
| M2 | Complete domain workflow | Representative task, native reopen, decode and targeted revision |
| M3 | ArtCraft cross-plugin collaboration | Version propagation, selective invalidation and interruption recovery |
| M4 | Host and release acceptance | Actual host installation, platform evidence and synchronized catalogs |

Change OpenSpec before behavior; check a task only after actual acceptance. Maintain both document languages. See CONTRIBUTING.md and AGENTS.md.

## License and upstream

Original content uses [Apache-2.0](LICENSE). This is a third-party integration design, not upstream endorsement. Treat the four apps’ code licenses separately from ArtCraft/Services restrictions; do not copy restricted source or brand assets.

[Upstream VectorCraft](https://github.com/storytold/vectorcraft) · [Issues](https://github.com/full-aigc-plugins/vectorcraft-plugin/issues)

Independent skills are pinned at the current published development tag `v0.1.0-dev.4`, including the exact source commit and whole-skill digest in `skills.lock.json`. Verify using `python3 scripts/vendor/skill_vendor.py check`. These source snapshots do not establish plugin-host acceptance or production readiness.

## Development skill installation and use

Install the independent skill: `npx skills add full-aigc-skills/vectorcraft-skills --skill vectorcraft-use`. Run the public entry from the actual installed directory; this plugin snapshot includes the same skill.

```bash
python3 -I -B skills/vectorcraft-use/scripts/bootstrap.py
python3 -I -B skills/vectorcraft-use/scripts/workflow.py --help
```

First use installs the pinned official CLI into user-level storage. Requires macOS arm64 and Python 3.11+. Use the bundled example with real input assets; consult SKILL.md for delivery and revision contracts. [Source verification](docs/evidence/skill-publication.json).

## Codex development host checks

All five plugins installed from public tags into an isolated Codex configuration. App-server discovered their namespaced skills without loading errors; the installed ArtCraft entry produced four native projects. [Host evidence](docs/evidence/codex-installation.json). These controlled development checks do not establish desktop GUI, other hosts, complete creative or production marketplace acceptance.

Development version `0.1.0-dev.1` pins the independent skill install-lock fix: bounded coordination for concurrent installation/reuse, with no native task replay.

The current development milestone adds hash-bound exchange loss reports to native deliveries. lost, observed and unknown are separate; derivatives never substitute for native projects. Font/effect/mask fidelity across editors remains unverified, so full exchange acceptance stays open.

## CLI and task skill suite

The source suite contains 12 independently installable skills with setup, public CLI operations and focused tasks. [Architecture and catalogue](docs/VectorCraft-Skill-Suite-Architecture.md). Runtime and plugin versions are separate; prior host evidence retains its original version scope.

Current plugin: `0.1.0-dev.5`; skill suite: `0.1.0-dev.4`. The corrected examples resolve scripts from the actual host-loaded `SKILL.md` directory. All skills passed isolated entry-point checks in user, project and plugin layouts with spaces. [Path evidence](docs/evidence/installed-skill-paths.json). Earlier host evidence above covers its recorded release; existing installations require an update.

Plugin `0.1.0-dev.5` corrects the whole-skill digests by fetching the immutable public source tag, without local Python caches. Plugin tag `v0.1.0-dev.4` is superseded and must not be installed because its source digests included ignored development caches.

Current plugin `0.1.0-dev.6` pins skill suite `0.1.0-dev.5`. Nine task skills each cold-installed and performed real native edits; selection, image embedding, symbol reuse and unaffected boards are verified. Full regression: 38 passed, no skips. [Evidence](docs/evidence/task-skill-first-use.json). Full creative/GUI/model acceptance remains pending.

Current fixed-release host verification (2026-10-06): Codex 0.153.4 installs all five current pinned plugins and discovers all 58 skills with exact content identity. This plugin’s representative native workflow runs from its actual installed skill path with a fresh native runtime; creation/reopening/revision checks pass. All 58 installed skill hashes remain unchanged after the five workflows. [Evidence](docs/evidence/codex-current-release-20261006.json). The shared explicit-tag generator belongs to ArtCraft. Model dispatch awaits authorization; GUI, creative and full host acceptance remain pending. This QA maintenance changes no published skill/runtime content or release tags.

The fixed FilmCraft dev.6 / EffectCraft dev.7 / PhotoCraft dev.6 / VectorCraft dev.6 / ArtCraft dev.17 matrix passed isolated Codex discovery of 58 skills and representative native workflows from installed skill content. All installed skill digests remained unchanged afterward. [Installed native evidence](docs/evidence/codex-release17-native-20261006.json). Model dispatch, GUI and complete creative acceptance remain unverified.
