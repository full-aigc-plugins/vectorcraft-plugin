# VectorCraft Domain technical design

> **Purpose**: Translate domain scenarios into compilable plans, fixtures and artifact checks.
>
> **Version**: 1.0.0
> **Updated**: 2026-10-05
> **Status**: Target design, not implemented. Observations and acceptance evidence are identified separately.

## 1. Plan boundary

The fields below are a proposed domain-plan design, not released CLI arguments. Implement final JSON schemas and consumer tests through the corresponding OpenSpec tasks; ArtCraft specifications remain authoritative for the shared task envelope.

| Field | Shape | Semantics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| document | id, units, colorMode, artboards | Define coordinates and units; artboards are not merely export indices |
| objects[] | id, kind, pathData, transform, style, groupId | Retain control points, closure and grouping |
| operations[] | id, operator, operandIds, expectedResultKind | Boolean operations use stable inputs and retain checkpoints |
| brandTokens | tokenId, value, bindings | Update bound objects, not all occurrences of a color |
| exports[] | artboardId, format, scale, outlineText, lossPolicy | Use stable artboard IDs; policy governs outlining and rasterization |

## 2. Compilation and execution

1. Verify assets and native-project revisions and preserve a checkpoint.
2. Discover command schemas, object IDs, units and available capabilities in the actual session.
3. Validate the domain plan and reject unsupported mappings with field-level errors.
4. Compile operations with stable object mapping, plan hash and runtime identity.
5. Execute under a single-writer lease and persist confirmed steps.
6. Save, close and reopen the native project, then export and collect evidence.
7. Use input/object diffs for targeted revisions and preserve unchanged parts.

## 3. Observed entrypoints and capability gates

| MCP tool | Evidence boundary |
| :--- | :--- |
| list_commands | Listed by the installed CLI through tools/list; only inspect_document has a recorded read-only execution probe. Other calls and editing outcomes are unverified |
| run_command | Listed by the installed CLI through tools/list; only inspect_document has a recorded read-only execution probe. Other calls and editing outcomes are unverified |
| inspect_document | Listed by the installed CLI through tools/list; only inspect_document has a recorded read-only execution probe. Other calls and editing outcomes are unverified |
| draw_shape | Listed by the installed CLI through tools/list; only inspect_document has a recorded read-only execution probe. Other calls and editing outcomes are unverified |
| draw_path | Listed by the installed CLI through tools/list; only inspect_document has a recorded read-only execution probe. Other calls and editing outcomes are unverified |
| set_paint | Listed by the installed CLI through tools/list; only inspect_document has a recorded read-only execution probe. Other calls and editing outcomes are unverified |

Tool names route discovery; parameters must come from actual inputSchema or describe results. Never guess object IDs from examples.

## 4. First acceptance fixture

One logo and three icons with two explicit brand-color tokens and multiple artboards; change the primary token. Verify every bound object changes and unbound colors remain unchanged; reopen the native document and inspect SVG paths separately.

Test assets and references must be redistributable and record fixed seeds or inputs. Set technical thresholds before execution; do not relax them after failures. Visual judgments record reference revision, evaluator and localized evidence.

## 5. Targeted revision and invalidation

Operation cache keys cover input hashes, object selection, edit parameters, runtime identity and output settings. Object IDs are not globally unique across projects and must bind a project revision. Re-inspect after user edits; if mapping is ambiguous, reject automatic overwrite and retain both versions. Local project edits and partial renderer caching are different capabilities: preserve untouched objects, but claim render-cache reuse only when upstream support is actually tested.

## 6. Delivery checklist and downstream consumption

| File or record | Check | Failure behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| .vectorcraft | Reopen and inspect objects and dependencies | Do not claim editable delivery |
| Preview and final export | Identify format, dimensions, duration and color/alpha | Retain diagnostics and rerun affected steps |
| Asset dependencies | Hashes, licensing, fonts and relative references | List missing items and block incomplete delivery |
| Acceptance record | Bind current artifacts, plan and runtime identity | Invalidate stale records without inheriting acceptance |
